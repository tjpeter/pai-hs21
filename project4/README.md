# Project 4 - Reinforcement Learning

**Implementing a policy gradient algorithm**

In this project you will implement a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for playing a variant of a game called “lunar lander”.


In the lunar lander environment, a lander must be controlled to land between two flags on the ground. When controlling the lander, the goal is to successfully land upright on its two legs, between the flags and in a limited timeframe, whilst expending minimal fuel. Your task is to implement an algorithm that, by practicing on a simulator, learns a control policy for the lander.
